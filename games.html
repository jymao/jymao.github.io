				A Unity game made in 72 hours for the Ludum Dare 41 game jam. The theme of the game jam was to combine two incompatible genres. 
				Conveyor Belt Hero is a mix of an infinite runner and a turn-based RPG, in which the player is constantly moving forward 
				while trying to defeat enemies quickly in order to level up and earn money. Money must be picked up before it moves off the screen, as 
				it necessary to buy healing potions at merchants. The player wins when the boss at the end is defeated before the final screen.

				A Unity game that recreates the turn-based battle system of Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean. 
				The player first chooses a deck of cards called Magnus. When the battle begins, the player must choose a sequence of Magnus in time to attack the enemy or defend during the enemy's turn. Magnus can have different elements, and opposing elements such as fire and water cancel each other out during damage calculation. Bonuses to damage are given depending on the elements and numbers of the Magnus chosen in the combo.
