			Transcension is a 2D Unity game in which the objective is to defeat all enemies on the current
			floor to progress to the next one. Each floor is randomly generated by choosing a rock pattern from
			predefined ones and by choosing an enemy type and how many to spawn. The number of enemies and the chance of
			spawning a more difficult type increases as the player clears more floors.

			This two-person project is the final iteration of the ray tracing engine built for the class.
			The first iteration involved basic ray tracing to render diffuse, reflective, and refractive
			materials. Next, bounding boxes and a bounding volume hierarchy are used to speed up the
			render time by reducing the number of ray intersection tests computed. Finally, progressive
			photon mapping is implemented for better visuals and more convincing refraction and caustics.

			StreetMeet is an Android mobile application developed by a group of six for 
			a mobile development class. The primary feature of the app is the use of Bluetooth LE
			beacons, which allows phones to advertise themselves and find other phones within range.
			The app will share the profile created by the user with other users that he or she passes by.
			This can be used like a business card, an informal resume, or a way to meet new people. Users
			can also set filters to see profiles with specific attributes.
